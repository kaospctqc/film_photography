                This is about pictures that have been created using older cameras: Canon AE-1 and Smena 6. Using film is more costly in terms of price per picture, time and energy invested. It also reduces the number of exposures taken and for me, this really helps prevent from getting overloaded with to many pictures to edit. The net result, in my experience, is that I have to have intention, do my best to remember what I took pictures of, analyze the results and use my conclusions when taking new pictures again. It really pushes me to be more present in the process from the moment I take the picture to the moment when I'm drying out my prints.

                I'm very much a beginner photographer at this stage, still trying to get a good grasp with the theoretical knowledge that I have. Still discovering verious types of photography and many new ways of creating interesting results by using different subjects, composing and cropping to find various details, different film stocks, new perspectives as well as experimenting with the basics (apperture, shutter speed, focus, film speed). All of this is it's own type of journey but I find it extraordinary to also search for other artists and get inspired by them.
